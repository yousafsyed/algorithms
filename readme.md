## DESCRIPTION:


Written by [Yousaf Syed](http://linkedin.com/in/yousafsyed)

Original Proposal: Using the right data structure or algorithm for the situation is an important
aspect of programming. In computer science literature, many data structures
and algorithms have been researched and extensively documented. However, there
is still no standard library in Php implementing useful structures and
algorithms like Red/Black Trees, tries, different sorting algorithms, etc.
This project will create such a library with documentation on when to use a
particular structure/algorithm. It will also come with a benchmark suite to
compare performance in different situations.
